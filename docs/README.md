This is an interpretable project on image classification models, mainly using CAM (Class Activation Mapping). It reveals to us the secrets behind image classification by Convolutional Neural Networks.

The project sequentially applies:

- CAM to a personal image classification model built on MNIST
- Directly applies CAM to different pre-trained models and compares the performance
- Compares CAM on different layers of GoogLeNet
- Applies CAM to another project by the author to see how the model understands humans
- Finally, with the help of OpenCV, real-time CAM is implemented to show how the model classifies the camera images.
